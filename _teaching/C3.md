Developed vision based systems for autonomous maneuvering of an intelligent ground vehicle in traversing within lanes, avoiding obstacles and maintaining its heading while navigating in unfamiliar territory.
* Designed an algorithm for robustly detecting lane regions in a video feed using PCA with region proposals from previous frames.
* Combined LiDAR and camera inputs to seperate obstacles and lanes in an image, as well as generate a semantic map for motion planning algorithms.
