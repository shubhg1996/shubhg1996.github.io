Developed a joint motion planning-mapping system for a robot such that costmap of the environment for mapping is generated on-demand based on motion planner queries.

* Implemented the system in ROS framework with code in python and C++
* Trained online learning based classifiers on real-world collected data with patch level supervision to accomodate for concept drift.
