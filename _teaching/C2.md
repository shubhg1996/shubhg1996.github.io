Created an application for applying a selective motion blur to an image by segmenting out a specified object.
* Modified and implemented ICCV 2017 paper "Extreme clicking for efficient object annotation".
* Developed a pipeline to take in annotation of extreme points of an object in image, find its crude boundary by generating minimum cost paths on weighted edge detections and segmentation refinement using graph-cut with this initialization.
