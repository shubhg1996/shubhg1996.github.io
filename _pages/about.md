I am a 4th year EE undergrad at IIT Kanpur, hailing from Delhi. I am passionate about robotics and embedded systems and find applications of computer vision in robotics and localisation/SLAM problems fascinating. I love listening to and playing music - I can play a variety of instruments including Guitar, Synthesizer, Flute, Mouth Organ and Drums.
