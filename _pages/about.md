I am a 4th year EE undergrad at IIT Kanpur. I hail from Delhi and like most of us delhiites, claim to be a big foodie. I am passionate about robotics and embedded systems and spend most of time tinkering with them. I find applications of computer vision in robotics and localisation/SLAM problems interesting. I love listening to and playing music - I can play a variety of instruments including Guitar, Synthesizer, Flute, Mouth Organ and Drums.
